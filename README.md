# Calculator Project 
## Skills Utilized
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
## Project Description
At the most basic level, this program is a calculator. The website allows the user to do basic caclulations and returns the answer to these, on top of this, the page also stores past equations and then displays them on the left side of the screen. The program also has both a light and dark mode. The user is able to switch between these with a swith in the top right corner, and the program will remember what was chosen when the page is reopened by the user. 

## Inspiration For Project Creation
While learning javascript I was taking a few online courses that reuired me to make a calculator project as well as a Dark to Light mode project. After creating them both I wanted to see if I could combine them to make something a little more complex.
